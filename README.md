In the src folder you will find the python code for the model described in the to be published paper "Social Information Feedback and the Value of Information in a Dynamic Game of Divorce", wherein our aim is to find evolutionarily stable strategies for social information use and divorce decision making for females of a sequentially monogamous species that forms long-term pair bonds, with uncertainty emerging from the state of the pairing pool. We include mortality $C_\mu$ and opportunity costs $C_o$ of gathering information about oneâ€™s partner, the annual mortality rate $\mu$ (determining lifespan and turnover rate of the population), reproductive outcome variation $\sigma$ (influencing how important partner quality is for fitness), and mate quality variation $\beta$  (determining the total proportion of high-quality partners in the population). We do this using a dynamic game in which males are either of high- or low-quality and females have a belief state $\pi$. $\pi$ is the probability that a partner is of high-quality. $\pi$ can be updated by costly observations of partner cues and is updated (cost free) by offspring mass at fledging every breeding season.
